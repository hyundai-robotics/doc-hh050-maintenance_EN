# 6.5. Encoder Zero Setting 

It is necessary to reset the origin when encoder data has been corrupted due to some problems and when the motor is replaced.

A scale or V-groove is used to determine the standard posture position for each axis of the robot. When the motor is replaced by the user, set the encoder using the scale or V-groove to have each axis at its original point.
