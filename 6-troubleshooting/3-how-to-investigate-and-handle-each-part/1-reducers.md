# 6.3.1. Reducer

Vibration and abnormal sound will be occurred when a reducer is damaged. In this case, it causes overload and abnormal deviation disturbing normal operation. Sometimes overheating may result. The robot may also become completely immovable, or a position offset error may occur.

When turning [ON][OFF] the brake release switch of axis H and axis V, be sure to take necessary precautions to prevent the ARM from dropping, and then switch the brake release [ON][OFF].

*	Diagnostics

    ①	Apply force to the 1st and the 2nd arms to investigate whether the bearings have any gap.<br>
    (When a chain block is to be used, maintain the 1st and the 2nd arms in their positions and check whether the bearings have any gap while not applying any load on the reducer.)<br>
    ②	Check if peripheral equipment has been contacted with the robot before the abnormality.


*	Resolution

    Replace the reducer. A chain block is needed to lift and hang the robot ARM. Contact our service office for any difficulties

When turning [ON][OFF] the brake release switch, be sure to take necessary precautions to prevent the ARM from dropping, and then switch the brake release [ON][OFF].

*	Diagnostics

    ①	Check out any vibration, abnormal sound, or overheating of the reducer when the robot is in operation.<br>
    ②	Check out any play in the reducer by shaking the End Effector (such as spot gun and hand devices, etc.) back and forth.<br> 
    ③	Turn motor off, with the brake release switch [ON], and check that the axis can be rotated by hand. If not, the reducer is in bad condition.<br> 
    Check if peripheral equipment has been contacted with the robot before the abnormality.
    (Damage may occur to the reducer due to the contacting impact)

*	Resolution

    ①	Replace the reducer.<br>
    ②	Replace the entire wrist section.<br>
    (The replacement of entire wrist should be a quick and reliable resolution as it takes time and necessary equipment for reducer replacement)
