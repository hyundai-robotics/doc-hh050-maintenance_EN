■	Grease Replacement

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
    <li>
Prepare a grease nipple (A-PT1/4) and then make the R2, B and R1-Axis 0°degree.
 </li><br>
    <li>Remove the plug TR6X6 of the grease inlet, and fasten the grease nipple A-PT1/4.
 </li><br>
    <li>Remove the plug G1/4 of the grease outlet.
 </li><br>
    <li>Inject the grease into the grease inlet using a grease gun.

<p>

-	Grease type : VIGO GREASE RE0
-	Amount of grease : 240cc (216g)  
 <p>

-	Grease type : RV GREASE LB00
-	Amount of grease : 240cc(209g) 
  </li><br>
    <li>
The grease replacement is complete when new grease appears in the outlet port. 
The new grease can be distinguished from the old one by color.
</li><br>
    <li>	Move the R2-Axis for a few minutes to eject the old grease and then add grease until the new grease appears in the outlet port.
</li><br>
    <li>Discharge excessively fueled grease and residual pressure. (Refer to the discharge procedure below.)
</li><br>
    <li>Remove the grease nipple of the inlet and assemble the inlet plug.
</li>
</ol>

■	Injecting grease after replacing the reducer
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
    <li>
Prepare a grease nipple (A-PT1/4) and then make the R2, B and R1-Axis 0°degree.
</li><br>

</li><br>
    <li>Remove the grease outlet plug.
</li><br>
    <li>Inject the grease into the grease inlet using a grease gun.

<p>

-	Grease type : VIGO GREASE RE0
-	Amount of grease : 300cc (270g)  
 <p>

-	Grease type : RV GREASE LB00
-	Amount of grease : 300cc(261g) 
  </li><br>
    <li>
The grease replacement is complete when new grease appears in the outlet port.
</li><br>
    <li>Discharge excessively fueled grease and residual pressure. (Refer to the discharge procedure below.)

■	Procedure in discharging excessively fueled grease and residual pressure after grease replacement and injection
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
    <li>Attach a grease receiver or a hose to the grease outlet to prevent contamination from discharged grease.
</li><br>
    <li>Operate it within a range without surrounding and interference under the following conditions.

①	Operation angle: 60° or more

②	Operation speed: 100%

③	Operation time: 1.5 hours or more

④	Work so that the injected amount and the discharged amount are the same. If the discharged amount is less, the residual amount needs to be discharged through the inlet.
</li><br>
    <li>Wipe the outlet port with a cloth and attach the plug.
