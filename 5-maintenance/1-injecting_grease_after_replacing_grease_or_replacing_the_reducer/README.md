    <td colspan="4">If the grease is not properly injected, the internal pressure in the injection part may suddenly increase, causing the oil seal damage, oil leakage, and abnormal operation. Abnormal sound may be generated when replacing the current grease with new grease of a different specification, so make sure that different types of grease should not be mixed together. Therefore, you must observe the following items when injecting grease.</td>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
		<li>
Make sure to wear safety glasses before injecting grease and inspection
  </li><br>
    <li>
Before starting to grease, remove the plug from the grease outlet
  </li><br>
    <li>
When loosening a plug, grease and the plug could be discharged. Block the outlet with a thick cloth to prevent injuries caused by discharged grease or plug, and keep a distance away for safety. (Do not look into the grease outlet.)
  </li><br>
    <li>
Whenever possible, avoid using a compressed-air pump, powered by the factory air supply. If the use of a compressed-air pump is unavoidable, restrict the greasing pressure less than 1.5bar(1.5kgf/cm2)
  </li><br>
    <li>
Use grease only of the specified type. If not, may damage the reducer or lead to other problems
  </li><br>
    <li>
After injecting it, remove the residual pressure from each axis and tighten the plugs according to the given procedure.

        <li>
After greasing, confirm that no grease is leaking from the grease outlet and that the grease bath is not pressurized, then re-attach the plug in the grease outlet.
    </li><br>
    <li>
To prevent accidents caused by slipping, completely remove any excess grease from the floor or robot.
    </li><br>
    <li>
When an ambient temperature is more than 35℃, be sure to shorten the period of replenishment in half.
    </li><br>
    <li>
When replacing grease, replace the specified amount and inject new grease as much as the amount of the discharged grease.
    </li><br>
    <li>
If an abnormal sound is generated from the reducer part during operation after replenishment or replacement of grease, at low temperature, at low speed, or after long-term non-operation, you need to operate the robot while checking the state of the abnormal sound for one or two days. Abnormal sound caused by grease will disappear.
    </li><br>
    <li>
If the grease with a different specification is injected into the reducer part that has been greased already, an abnormal sound may occur. Therefore, do not mix these different types of grease.
    </li><br>
    <li>
An abnormal sound may occur even if the existing grease is replaced with the new grease of the same designated specification as the existing grease.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Replacing the grease is not for completely removing the existing grease. A significant amount of existing grease will remain.
</li><br>	
</ol>

<br>
■ Periodic Replacement

-	S-axis Reducer, Arm Frame Gear Box : 24,000 hours
-	Other Reducers : 12,000 hours

 <br>

If there is still noise in the reducer even after using specified grease, check the state closely for 1-2 days during operation. Generally, the noise will go away.
(The noise will go away if you run the axis at a high speed for 5-10 minutes).
- It can be checked if the abnormal sound will disappear even when the concerned axis is operated at high speed for about 5 to 10 minutes or more.
- When the old grease is discharged as much as possible (about 90% or more) and replaced with new grease, the abnormal grease sound can be minimized. (When the grease is discharged while the axis is rotating at low speed, the grease discharge time can be shortened.)


An abnormal sound usually occur in the following cases:
-	During operation after replacement of grease/reducer
-	During operation after a long-term non-operation
-	During operation at low speed
-	During operation at low temperature 
-	When using unspecified grease 
-	Mixing grease of different specifications
