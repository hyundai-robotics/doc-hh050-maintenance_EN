# 3.5.2. Installation the Robot Manipulator

The base floor to install the robot should be constructed with concrete with a thickness of 300mm or more so that the hardness minimizes dynamic effect to the robot. Repair bumps and cracks on the concrete surface of the floor during installation, and fix the mounting place with M20 Chemical Anchor. And if the thickness of the concrete floor is less than 300mm, it requires an independent base construction that must be reviewed beforehand. 
Locate the robot unit on the mounting plate and tightly assemble 8 M20 bolts.

*	Bolt: M20*70 (Hardness level: 12.9) 
*	Flat washer: T = 4mm or above, internal diameter (ID) = 24, hardness of HrC 35
*	Assembly torque: 530±20Nm
