# 2.9. Restricting the Working Envelope

When installing the robot, take into account that the working envelope can be adjusted freely within the entire working envelope. 

Limiting the motion range is useful when: 

*	During robot operation
*	When the robot is likely to collide with another device
*	When the length of the application cables or hose pipes are limited

There are three methods to use to limit the motion range of the robot as follows:

*	Software limit (applied to the entire axis)
*	Limit switch (1-3 axis: optional application)
*	Mechanical stopper (1-3 axes)

The mechanical stopper is a physical device. The robot should not exceed the area occupied by the mechanical stopper. The mechanical stopper of a 1-3 axis is fixed. The mechanical stopper with a 4-6 axis is applied only within the software limits.

Once the mechanical stopper is collided with, its strength cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, please ensure it is replaced after impact.
